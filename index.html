# Quick notes:

- Files are stored in [Cache Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage)
- [Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) interfaces with Cache Storage
- Caches are tied to an origin
- An origin can have multiple caches
- Service Workers refresh every 24hrs
