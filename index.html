# Quick notes:

- Both functions use the [Cache API](link)
- [Cache Storage](link) holds on to the files
- Caches are tied to an origin
- An origin can have multiple caches
---

# Quick notes:

- Service Workers refresh every 24 hrs
- Updating the cache name triggers reinstall
- Don't change the SW file name!
